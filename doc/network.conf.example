/* These are the blacklist settings.
 * You can have multiple combinations of host and rejection reasons.

 *
 * These settings should be adequate for most networks.
 *
 * Word to the wise: Do not use blacklists like SPEWS for blocking IRC
 * connections.
 *
 * As of charybdis 2.2, you can do some keyword substitution on the rejection
 * reason. The available keyword substitutions are:
 *
 *   ${ip}           - the user's IP
 *   ${host}         - the user's canonical hostname
 *   ${dnsbl-host}   - the dnsbl hostname the lookup was done against
 *   ${nick}         - the user's nickname
 *   ${network-name} - the name of the network
 *
 * added in irca: this block will also now contain an example of using Tor
 * Project's DNSEL to block users (or direct them to use your hidden service
 * if you have one), using the IP 1.2.3.4 as an example. substitute your own
 * ipv4 bindhost, and use all port numbers you listen on TCP using, rather than
 * just 6667.
 *
 * also included is an example of using dronebl.
